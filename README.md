# Hair Code

This repository holds our group capstone project for Digital Crafts where we were instructed to build a website. We chose to create a site where a user can sign up and log in to their HairCode account. From there, they will be asked a few questions about their hair type. The user can keep a log of if and when their hair was last dyed as well as when their last appointment was and what the stylist did during. This website would help salons and clients with communication and would save them both a lot of time.

We were given a lot of freedom in the project so it was great to collaborate together to create something after learning so much during our 16-week coding bootcamp. Seeing what we could accomplish as a group was very gratifying. This was an experience we will all remember.

### Prerequisites

In order for the project to work on your computer, should you clone it, you'll need to install the following:

```
npm install
npm install axios
npm install moment react-moment
```

## Collaboration Notes

-   We worked together through Github and would push and pull our changes. There were quite a few merge conflicts but we were able to fix any and all issues that arose.

-   Firebase was something new we've never used before so it was an interesting challenge. We had a limited time frame to learn how to use this for our database but we were able to successfully incorporate it into our project.

-   As a group, we divided up work between ourselves and helped each other when we got stuck. It was a great way to practice communication and also how to handle a situation where members had conflicting ideas. Through compromise or alternate solutions, we were able to come to a conclusion that we were all satisfied with.
